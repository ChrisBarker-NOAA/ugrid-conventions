UGRID Conventions
=================
* [Version 0.9.0 of UGRID Conventions](https://github.com/ugrid-conventions/ugrid-conventions/blob/v0.9.0/ugrid-conventions.md)

This project contains a proposed standard for storing unstructured (or flexible mesh) model data in a network common data form (NetCDF) file. 

The standard was developed over a period of several years through the [UGRID Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ugrid-interoperability) which had members from many different unstructured grid modeling communities (including SELFE, ELCIRC, FVCOM, ADCIRC).  The first draft of this standard was created by the hard work of Bert Jagers (Deltares), with help from the rest of the UGRID Google Group members.
