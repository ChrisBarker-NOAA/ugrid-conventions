Unstructured Grid Metadata Conventions for Scientific Datasets


**Latest updates**:
* Feb 28, 2013: use topology_dimension attribute rather than dimension, as suggested by Jonathan Gregory [here](http://www.met.rdg.ac.uk/~jonathan/CF_metadata/ugrid_gridspec.html).
* Sep 12, 2012: closed clockwise discussion, explained meaning of Optionally required attributes.
* Nov 1, 2011: The section of creating mosaics of meshes has been moved to this [child page](https://publicwiki.deltares.nl/display/NETCDF/Mosaics+of+meshes). Since experience with unstructured grid mosaics is still limited, and demand is low, the mosaics are not yet part of the current proposal.
